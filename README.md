# VBA-Challenge
Unit 2 VBA Challenge | Stock Market Analysis | UC Davis Spring 2021

For this challenge I used VBA in Excel to assess the annual performance of over 3,000 stocks from 2015 to 2017. I started with data on the daily opening and closing values for each stock, along with each stock's daily highest and lowest values. I then iterated through each row of data to find the yearly change, percent change, and total annual volume for each stock.

From this analysis I found the following conclusions on for each year:

**2014:**
Greatest % Increase:	DM	5581.16%
Greatest % Decrease:	CBO	-95.73%
Greatest Total Volume:	BAC	21,595,474,700


**2015:**
Greatest % Increase:	ARR	491.30%
Greatest % Decrease:	KMI.W	-98.59%
Greatest Total Volume:	BAC	21,277,761,900

**2016:**
Greatest % Increase:	SD	11675.00%
Greatest % Decrease:	DYN.W	-91.49%
Greatest Total Volume:	BAC	27,428,529,600
