# VBA-Challenge
Unit 2 VBA Challenge | Stock Market Analysis | UC Davis Spring 2021

For this challenge I used VBA in Excel to assess the annual performance of over 3,000 stocks from 2015 to 2017. I started with data on the daily opening and closing values for each stock, along with each stock's daily highest and lowest values. I then iterated through each row of data to find the yearly change, percent change, and total annual volume for each stock.

From this analysis I found the following conclusions on for each year:

2014: 
Ticker	Value
Greatest % Increase	DM	5581.16%
Greatest % Decrease	CBO	-95.73%
Greatest Total Volume	BAC	21595474700![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26308909/119279866-2bb22e80-bbe3-11eb-91a7-45bdf1a7a9d6.png)

2015:
Ticker	Value
Greatest % Increase	ARR	491.30%
Greatest % Decrease	KMI.W	-98.59%
Greatest Total Volume	BAC	21277761900![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26308909/119279882-42f11c00-bbe3-11eb-8deb-5c6a4c3415a7.png)

2016:
Ticker	Value
Greatest % Increase	SD	11675.00%
Greatest % Decrease	DYN.W	-91.49%
Greatest Total Volume	BAC	27428529600![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26308909/119279888-4be1ed80-bbe3-11eb-9b3f-1c03c28cb8ea.png)
